# Assessment 1 – Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project is part of my Machine Learning course assessment in Tutedude.

The goal of this project is to predict food delivery time and analyze the factors that affect delivery performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is:

- To predict delivery time using Linear Regression
- To classify deliveries as Fast or Delayed using Logistic Regression
- To understand how distance, traffic, weather, and experience affect delivery time

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

- Distance between customer and restaurant
- Traffic conditions
- Weather conditions
- Delivery person experience
- Order cost
- Delivery time

---

## ⚙️ What I Did in This Project

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset
- Checked for missing values
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Created a new feature called **Rush_Hour**
- Converted categorical data into numerical format using one-hot encoding
- Standardized numerical features

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked basic statistics
- Created correlation heatmap
- Generated scatter plots and pair plots
- Detected outliers using boxplots

---

### 3️⃣ Linear Regression
Used to predict delivery time.

Evaluation metrics used:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

---

### 4️⃣ Logistic Regression
Used to classify deliveries as Fast (0) or Delayed (1).

Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

---

## 📌 Key Observations

- Distance and traffic conditions significantly impact delivery time.
- Rush hour increases the chances of delay.
- Experienced delivery personnel reduce delays.
- Both regression and classification models performed reasonably well.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped me understand the complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

It also gave practical experience in applying regression and classification techniques to real-world problems.
